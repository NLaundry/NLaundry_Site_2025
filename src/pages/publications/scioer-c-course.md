# SCIOER Course: C Programming

[Available Here](https://yc-prod-openlibrary-repo.ecampusontario.ca/jspui/handle/123456789/1786)

## Description

This resource is part of an investigation into a semi-automated process for creating Self-Contained, Interactive Open Educational Resources (SCIOER) for use by students and instructors in the discipline of Computer Science.

Resources created through the SCIOER process are self-contained and provide all the tools necessary for learners. The interactive nature of the resource encourages experimentation and incremental practice. Learners are able to annotate SCIOER resources with their personal observations and learnings.

The SCIOER C Programming course is provided as a docker image (https://hub.docker.com/r/scioer/c-programming). The docker container provides a fully interactive e-text for programmers who wish to improve their knowledge of the C programming language.
