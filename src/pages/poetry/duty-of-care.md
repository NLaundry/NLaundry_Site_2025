# Duty of Care

## Burn

The sun and all its siblings

could fair no better

in the gruesome work

of burning my soul

than the friction

between our hearts

as yours

is torn 

from mine

## Duty of Care

To have failed so

in my duty of care

in my guardianship of your heart

I bear this penance

of solitude

to feel your pain as my own

with no solace

of companionship

nor numbing agent

to feel the loss of us

honestly

in excruciating reverence

## Shine

"How brightly you shine"

"Only as the moon borrows light from its sun"
