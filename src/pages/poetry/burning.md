## Fluent 

I've become

fluent in the silence

that comes

before the storm

## Tip

I still taste your name

on the tip of my tongue

each time

I speak of love

## Look

I craved your gaze so deeply

that I pulled myself apart

showering you

in the pieces of me

like a rose

petal by petal

just to piece myself back together 

in the image

of the man

I thought you wanted

to see

## Thread

You loved me as a needle

runs a thread

through the torn and worn

so deep did you puncture

so long did you run

until the tapestry of my being

was more you than me

## Departure

Departure was etched into your flesh.

long before I'd met you

you'd set a collision course with ruin.

How it broke me 

to realize

our love could only hold you from it

for so long.

## Smuggle

We smuggled love on bookmarks

## Sting

I hope

the memories of us 

sting just enough

for you to remember I mattered

to remember

I loved you

## Told

I once asked you not to make me just another one of your sad stories

Now I ache to know I'm still told

## Stories

You're all my favourite stories

that I never tell
